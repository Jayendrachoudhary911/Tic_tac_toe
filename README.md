# Hey ðŸ‘‹ What's up?
This is my new project named `Tic Tac Toe` that I've just build using Html & Css.
Ins this project  the color theme That I,ve used are:-
- `#f5f5f5` - main background color 
- `#c0c0c0` - primary color

- `#caf3ff` - x container color
- `#ffe4db` - o container color

In this game you can play our childhood fav game **Tic Tac Toe** online and it is limit less to play on every device as it is perfectly responsive.
